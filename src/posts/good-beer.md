_[Edit: Due to my generally sleep-deprived state, I managed to confuse the uncapping date with the version of the Epic I actually have. Corrected.]_

Today is the day. I happened upon a bottle of Stone's Vertical Epic 11.11.11 edition in July, not really knowing anything about the story. Having had a couple products from Stone and being very satisfied, however, I decided to give it a try. It wasn't until I read over the label that I realized I had made an investment, and not a selection for the night. But now the time has come to open it up and see if it survived the 1300 mile journey from the Midwest, the loss of power for five days, and the moving of my fridge at least three times. I'm taking this in celebration of a year that includes an engagement, an acceptance, a move, another birthday, and one more year above water. To me the holidays are just another time of year like any other. I'll celebrate the things and people I care about any old time.
