# Cibele
There isn't a *whole* lot to say about Cibele mostly because it's such a short 
game. What is there, however, is not fantastic. I actually relate somewhat to the
story, having spent all of my high school years and the beginning of college in
an online-only relationship type situation. Unfortunately, the story is not well
served by the dialog. It's one thing to try to lend a natural feel to spoken
dialog, but the halting, unsure speech of socially awkard late teenagers makes
for a really difficult interaction to stay interested in. Add to that the fact
that most of the dialog takes place as a pseudo-background to a click-fest
game-within-a-game and every line starts to feel like an eternity.

I can appreciate what the game, as much as you can call it that, was for the
developer, but from the outside, it feels like reading your high school crushes
journal as a thirty year old. It might have resonated a bit more if I was younger,
but now it's dull bordering on silly.

# Thomas Was Alone
I actually finished the story proper of Thomas Was Alone a while ago, but since
the achievements end at about the same time the narrative wraps up nicely, I
never even realized there was more until a good time later, and then it took me
a very long time to remember to actually play it.

As a review, following Cibele is night and day. This is a simple puzzle platformer
about shapes developing sentience, and yet with the combination of brilliant writing
and perfectly delivered dialog you feel more connected to a set of squares and
rectangles than you do to most uncanny valley, high-budget AAA main characters.

I have very little to complain about with Thomas Was Alone apart from its length,
which was only a disappointment because it was so much fun. That said its not
certain that it would have been improved with more length. It's good to know when
to end a thing. My only other gripe is that it is a bit too easy to miss dialog
if you're moving fairly well through an area. It doesn't always take enough time
to complete a section of a level for the dialog to finish and it often advances
the narrative prematurely.

Overall though, just play it.

# Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries
I was really hoping this game would be good. I'm actually a fan of the 2.5D style
and I like adapted fairy-tale type narratives. Unfortunately, this game is plagued
by a lot of strange choices and behavior it's hard to say a whole lot positive.
Add to that the fact that it was setup as an episodic adventure and there isn't
even a redeeming narrative arc to fall back on.

To start, 2.5D for me is best when the dimensional transitions are clear cut.
Woolfe more often feels like 3D with a locked camera, and with the low angle that
was chosen, it becomes incredibly difficult to judge distance and player location.
This makes the various platforming elements frustrating rather than challenging
as you make a straight jump to the right only to fall to your death as the road
you were on curves away unexpectedly. Perhaps the most strikingly bad example is
late in the game where you're confronted with floating, moving platforms; a spinning
drum you traverse while spiralling upward; and a lot of leap-of-faith jumps where
your destination is almost entirely off-screen.

The dialog here is also a bit of a wash. Unlike a lot of reviewers I've seen, I
don't have a problem with the rhyming, but there's very little content and a lot
of filler, all of which is a bit stilted and by the end of the game, I really
didn't have a great idea of what was going on, nor did I care.

All in all, this was not what I was hoping it would be. Without any chance of a 
sequel though, I won't have to decide whether to give it a chance to improve over
time.

# Year Walk
This is definitely the weirdest of the games on this list. Another short game,
but like Thomas Was Alone, the content feels packed in without filler to extend
the runtime. I can see how a game with fairly simple puzzles, a short narrative arc,
and a slightly educational tone could not appeal to everybody, but for me it
hits pretty well.

I initially bought this based entirely on the explanation of year walking I found
when I saw the game on sale originally. I'm a sucker for mythology from the real
world making its way into modern media, so it was a pretty easy sale.

What I got was a pretty entertaining little game. For a game with some "horror"
elements there isn't an over-reliance on jump scares, which would have cheapened
the experience. Instead, you get a puzzle game that can be played without having
to overdose on coffee ahead of time.

There isn't a whole to say that wouldn't ruin the story, and the kind of person
that likes this genre probably doesn't need a lot of expounding on its virtues,
but I will say that the one thing I feel it lacked in the end was some sense of
choice which for me might have made it feel less like a story being told to me
than an interactive experience.

If you're in the market for a cool game that can be completed in a day, pick this
up.
