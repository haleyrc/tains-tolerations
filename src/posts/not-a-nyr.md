title: Not A New Year's Resolutionist
---

For regular gym-goers, January is a stressful time, and the New Year's Resolutionist is the cause.

The chart above shows the Google Trends chart for the term 'fitness'.
The January peaks are clearly visible.
In my case, however, my recent burst of physical activity has nothing to do with the new year, other than the fact that my birthday and christmas both closely precede it.

Thanks to some generous cash gifts, my fiancee and I were able to obtain a set of squat stands, a flat/decline/incline bench, some foam floor mats, a seventy-pound heavy bag, and a set of handwraps and gloves for myself (the fiancee already had her own).
Even though we only recently started back into lifting, and my weights are still pathetically low to prevent atrophy injury, I can say that I am overjoyed.
The addition of a heavy bag makes the whole experience even more amazing.
At my heaviest, I was 223 pounds, which even for my bodytype is unreasonably large.
It got bad enough that my back was hurting just from sitting, and getting out of the couch was an ordeal.
While our move and graduate school did throw a wrench in our lifting routine, I managed to avoid rubberbanding back to that gross state.
My injuries now are simply DOMS, bruised elbows and knees, and some impact pain in my joints; all exquisite reminders of recent physical exertion.

I look forward to continuing in my new activity, and hopefully I can reach a fighting state at least equal to the one I had in high school, even if I never actually spar again.
If I had to give one "resolution", I would make it to max out the big three lifts given my current weight set by March.
Even that leaves in the novice range, but hey, it's attainable, and it gives me a reason to get a new set of weights.

For now I have to go. It's time to lift heavy things and then set them back down.
