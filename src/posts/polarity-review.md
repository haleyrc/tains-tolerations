I recently hit 100% completion on Polarity from the developers at Bluebutton Games and I thought I'd do the usual thing and throw some impressions on to the web for people to grump about. Polarity is a first-person puzzle game in a Portal-esque style that requires you to change your character's polarity between red and blue to overcome a number of challenges to ultimately reach the exit, while collecting three data packets per level for advancement.

This was not a game that was at the top of my wishlist, but Steam summer sales being what they are, I picked it up for some quick puzzling. In that sense, it was a great purchase. The game comes with Steam cards and achievements, for those that are interested, but also boasts a fun, if not entirely novel, mechanic for solving some relaxing puzzles.

Another huge selling point is the inclusion of local co-op, which meant that the Missus could help me grab a couple achievements while we spent quality time together.

There are a few spots where the mechanics fell flat however. I'm not one to shy away from challenge, but I think it should be obvious at this point that precision platforming in a first person perspective just doesn't work well. The gap between an actual human's peripheral vision and ability to rapidly change visual scenes for awareness and what can be achieved in a video game is just too great. A number of the otherwise fun puzzles in this game were overshadowed by the fact that there just isn't the precision required to make the platforming work.

The only other stumbling block was some very late-game hand-yoga that was required to rapidly shift polarities while sprint-jumping. It's a bit difficult, even for my seasoned PC gaming hands, to hold W and shift, and then rapidly double-tap Q mid-air. This is made especially frustrating because this is not a skill that has been practiced before the end, and doesn't show up again in the only level remaining at that point.

Overall, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth, and would have been happy to play some more levels as long as the precision stuff was left behind for the more relaxed puzzle mechanics. There were a couple minor bugs, but nothing game breaking and the pace was nice for an evening of couples gameplay. Don't go looking for anything overly challenging on the mental front, but for a quick diversion with a minimum of hair pulling, Polarity is definitely worth a look.
