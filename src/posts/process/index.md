Two of my favorite things in life are process and James Bond. The latter is easy to explain, even if somewhat subjective. The former is a bit more obscure. I have always found joy in well-defined, deliberate processes and my drinking is no different.

I have never been a fan of martinis, though in all fairness, my only forays into that space were ones I made myself as a much younger individual. I am sure that the subpar spirits and ham-fisted mixing did not contribute positively to the experience. While reading the original Casino Royale a few years back, however, I was inspired to try a new type of martini that lacked my least favorite part of the more traditional option: vermouth. Thus emboldened I struck out to gather ingredients. In my effort to maintain authenticity as much as possible, I procured Gordon's gin, Russian vodka, and Lillet Blanc, the closest relative to the Kina Lillet from the original. If only it were easier to get period and location accurate strength liquors in the United States, I would feel much more complete, but I digress. The pieces in place, I made my first Vesper martini and was immediately hooked.

Most of the "reviews" of the drink I have seen describe it as harsh and unbalanced, but perhaps that's what I was looking for because it fits my bill perfectly. As part of the ever important process, the enjoyment of my drink came with a soundtrack of Bond theme songs both old and new. This indulgence continued until the Wife and I moved, at which point it was too much hassle to transport my still perfectly full bottle of Lillet Blanc. What a mistake it was to discard it.

Having moved to a much more rural location, I found that it is impossible to find specialty liquors and that in fact most liquor store owners in my area have no idea what I am even referring to. But persistence pays off, and five stores and three cities later, I found Lillet again. Upon stumbling across this mystical cache, I purchased three bottles and am confident that will last me for a good long while.

Restocked and reinvigorated, the house reverberates with the sounds of Carly Simon, Chris Cornell, Tina Turner and more and I can enjoy the labors of a very indulgent process.
