Well, my resolution to try to keep this blog up throughout the school year didn&apos;t go quite as well as I would have liked.
Between coursework, paid work, trying to maintain a home, and trying to spend any time with my fianc&#x00E9;e, I&apos;ve been left with very little time for personal projects.
I thought though, that I would include an update on my goings on, as well as a renewed promise to attempt to fill some space here with general thoughts.

In order to be thorough, I will break down this update into sections and address each in turn.

## Books

I haven&apos;t had as much time for personal reading as I would like, but I have been able to get at least a little done in my downtime at work, and have thus completed the first three James Bond novels.
I have always been a James Bond fan, but had never actually read any of the books, which seemed like a bit of a blasphemy.
Amazon has the whole series in a paperback series with a set of really cool covers (yes these things matter to me).
What&apos;s more, they all run under ten dollars.

- [Live and Let Die](http://goo.gl/heuXn)
- [Moonraker](http://goo.gl/aqLAS)

_(Side note: While I have not historically been a fan of martinis, in honor of the new movies which for me have revitalized what had become a farce, as well as my foray in the novels, I decided to give the Vesper cocktail from Casino Royale a try. This is definitely worth a shot for anyone looking for a strong but easy to swallow drink. The price is right as well due to Gordon&apos;s low price despite high quality.)_

## School

There is a lot of information that could go here, but I doubt much of it would be very interesting.
Suffice it to say, this last semester was by far the most difficult in terms of time management.
While only taking 12 credits, I was also working part-time in the campus mail room, as well part time as a student grader.
On top of this, each of my three courses included a major project involving group work, and a large number of research tasks, both reading and writing.
I did survive, though, and only one course had a grade that I&apos;m not happy with.

This summer begins my thesis work with the seminar course, and then in the fall the actual thesis kicks off.
Additionally, I will be taking my first official course on natural language processing.
This course ends up being entirely voluntary, but I couldn&apos;t pass up the opportunity, even if it means a bit of extra work.
Hopefully I will have the time to post about it throughout.

## Home

Summer is almost upon us, which means the temperature in my century-old, un-air conditioned house will be starting to climb.
The result of this is a lot of time spent on my back porch.
Thankfully, we have been a bit proactive this year and gotten the whole thing fixed up and decorated in anticipation.

Instead of me reiterating, head over to the [lady&apos;s blog](http://kunstlichekadi.blogspot.com/2013/05/porch-a-project.html) for a good rundown of the project.

Apart from that, the big news is the signing of a new lease securing this amazing house for another year.
Even better, our current boarder will be leaving, netting us more space and freedom, and ridding us of what had become a toxic situation.

## Projects

### Media Server

This project is a bit of a sore spot right now, since it was done, and then failed and now has to be fixed.
The setup is a Raspberry Pi attached directly to the TV and connected via Ethernet to the Samba share on the router which serves up all my media.
This was working flawlessly, but something got corrupted on the flash media and the SD card now has to be reimaged.
While this is not a complicated process, it does mean that the entire library will have to be rescanned and indexed on the Pi; a process which takes many hours.
I need to just bite the bullet and get it working again though, as carting a flash drive back and forth is just so archaic.

### Router

This project is mostly done at this point, despite not having updated the previous blog post with the rest of the steps I took.
At the moment, the router is home to a Teamspeak 3 server, as well as two Minecraft servers, and seems to be running quite well under a pretty substantial load.
The remainder of what is to be done is to get some sort of interface set up, but this is described in the Node section below.

### Node

This is more of a group of projects than any single one, but since none of them have been well described yet, I&apos;m just including these all under one heading.
The hope is to use Node.js and Backbone as a front end for the router, as well as a central information accumulator for a future home assistant project.
As I said, these ideas haven&apos;t been well fleshed out, I just want to try my hand at some server-side Javascript, and perhaps incorporate some RCON and Query for the Minecraft and Teamspeak servers.

### Neural Net

This is an ongoing project that started my first semester and has been modified pretty heavily since then.
I attempted to design a distributed neural network for a course, but ran into a number of problems using Python.
In the spirit of learning a new language, as well as improving on a current design, I am in the process of porting my neural network code to Go.
I don&apos;t do a lot of work in compiled languages for my personal projects due mostly to the lack of any need for that kind of performance.
Since there is a real possibility that my thesis work will need to be a bit more sophisticated, however, I have decided to use Go for any future work requiring speed over ease of implementation.
A discussion of this choice will probably be my next post, as I feel it might be a bit heavy for an aside.

## Games

### Mass Effect

During the school year, especially this last semester, I wasn&apos;t able to get much gaming done.
I was able to finally finish Mass Effect (yes, the first one) after having started it a number of times in the past.
I did enjoy the story reasonably well, but it was a bit overshadowed by the extremely poor quality of the port to PC.
There were so many UI oddities and annoyances that my impression of the game overall suffered a bit.
I started ME2, however, and while I haven&apos;t made a lot of progress, it definitely feels like some care was taken this time around to address some of these issues.

### Mark of the Ninja

I just yesterday finished Mark of the Ninja, and I can say that it was easily one of the best games I have ever played.
Between the incredible art style, the near perfect controls, and the fluid interaction, this was definitely a good buy.
The real value though comes in the story which starts off somewhat unassuming, but manages to be the crown piece of this game in the end.

### Dragon Age

This is another game that I am a bit behind the curve in playing, due to my outright refusal to buy games at the sixty dollar price point.
A little patience and removing the need to be cutting edge means I can play all the same games, admittedly with some delay, for a fraction of the price.
In this case, the price was so good I even picked up a second copy for my lady.
As a big fan of KoToR, this game definitely feels familiar though with an obviously modified setting.
I&apos;m taking my campaign in pieces though, since I tend to be pedantic about hitting every dialog option and exploring every corner of the map.
I imagine it will be quite some time before I can call this one finished, but that&apos;s perfectly fine with me; just more value for the money.

### Team Fortress 2

This one I just recently got back into due to a weird craving for some good old-fashioned, no nonsense team combat.
The addition of a CTF mode since I last played doesn&apos;t help.
My FPS skills have definitely suffered, and I&apos;m happy these days if I can manage a $$2$$ frag ratio, but I still have some tricks that work well and have found very little to complain about in my time online.

### Borderlands 2

I definitely haven&apos;t gotten enough of this game in, due mostly to the fact that I can&apos;t stand playing this single-player.
This past weekend the lady and I managed to snag a few hours of some couples shooting, however, and I can say she&apos;s coming along nicely for this being her first FPS.
Plus, it&apos;s always nice to have someone to run out and draw psychos into the open so I can get my snipe on.

### Kerbal Space Program

What can I say about this game other than that I wish I was better at it.
Still a good time, but definitely a learning curve that I don&apos;t have a lot of time for at the moment.

### Poker Night at the Inventory and Poker Night 2

One of the few games I could fit in to my schedule in the last couple months was some rounds of poker in my breaks from studying.
These games, while not much of a challenge in the poker sense, were funny enough to keep me occupied for a good amount of time.
And who doesn&apos;t love getting hats for TF2 and BL2 in the process.

### Torchlight 2

A recent purchase, and the last game on my list, this was another one I got for both me and the lady to play.
I always love a good ARPG and Torchlight 2 definitely delivers.
This one feels much more open than the previous iteration and there are a lot of comforts added in for the player experience.
I don&apos;t have much time in this game yet, but that is sure to be rectified over the summer.

I think that about wraps up my not so brief update.
Hopefully the next post will be in less than three months.
