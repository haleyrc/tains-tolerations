The time has finally come! After many months of waiting, my long awaited Steam controllers have arrived. They replace the aging, wired, Xbox 360 controllers I have been using, and man are they an upgrade. For one, my very grabby 1-year old might find it a bit harder to yank these by force from my computer. That alone is worth the switch. On top of that, it's nice to try something that veers from the well-worn dual-stick road. I'm sure there will be plenty of push back from people who don't care to modify their play style, but it's worth the learning curve as far as I'm concerned.

Initial Impression

Apart from the obvious differences, the controller feels fairly familiar, borrowing heavily from the Xbox design, but with an overall feel that fits a bit better in my hand. Perhaps it's coming off of a controller with a 10 foot cord pulling on it, but the new kid feels quite a bit lighter, and I would actually like a little bit more heft just to make it feel more substantial. I was immediately pleased by  the placement and layout of the shoulder/trigger buttons. The layout of the 360 controller often had my pointer fingers resting on the shoulder buttons, but with my middle fingers pulled up off the triggers and pressing uncomfortably into the solid divide between the two. Not really knowing what to expect as far as feedback, I was pleasantly surprised by the little touches that make an otherwise detached experience feel like it’s doing “something”. I’ve ranted on numerous occasions about the rise of touchscreens and the decline of physical interfaces, and the Steam controller could easily fall into a category that would get my blood up, but just the little bit of noise and feedback when using the controls makes the whole thing feel less vague.

Testing
---

I've spent the first weekend testing as wide a variety of games as I can to see where it starts to break down. So far, I've only found a very small section of my library that just won't work, and these tend to be outliers for one reason or another. The original Dark Forces was a no-go, for instance, but to be honest, that barely works at all these days. Additionally, Point Perfect, a game requiring minute mouse control and relying heavily on click-and-drag mechanics is completely unplayable and I would wager that it's best to stay away from anything requires quick precise mouse pointing, unless there are any pro-gamers out there using trackballs. Anything that requires a hundred key-bindings is still out as well. But for pretty much anything else, it seems to work just fine. One of the stand-outs in my testing, however, was Shadowgate. A game relying almost entirely on mouse interaction one which the Steam controller handled with aplomb.

The widespread utility of the controller is due primarily to the staggering level of customization available. My eyes glossed over just trying to take in the number of options available and it will be a long time before my perennial games are set up optimally. Thanks to the fact that you can save and share controller setups, though, it's remarkably easy to get up and running.

Issues
---

Despite the entirely new trackpad paradigm, the feature which will perhaps take the most time to get used to is the grip buttons. I can see these being extremely useful, but I'm just not conditioned to use them yet, and they seem best bound to certain functions which don't require presses in quick succession. They do however cause some issues with my instinct of death gripping the controller at the first sign of trouble. Apart from that, there is a definite context switch moving to the trackpads being the central focus, with action buttons being the goto at the bottom of the controller. I suspect this is due to Valve’s desire to make the trackpads the central source of input events, a goal which seems eminently achievable given the number of actions which can be bound to them. This will, however, require some time and patience as games are designed with the new system in mind, and community profiles are added which make full use of it.

Conclusion
---

Overall, the Steam controller was the ideal replacement for my existing pair. They have all the functionality of a standard Xbox controller, but with so many more options for my catalog. I’m not a pro-gamer by any stretch, so a period of settling-in time is perfectly acceptable and I for one am excited to relearn how I play games in the future.
