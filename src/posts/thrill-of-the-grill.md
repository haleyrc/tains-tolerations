Not that grilling is an activity unique to myself, but I have always felt a large amount of attachment to large, outdoor, food-heating devices. I don't know if it's my Kansas City upbringing, or just a natural love of protein products, but I will take any chance I can get to get out of the kitchen and make food over some nice hot coals.

My Missus' mother got us a simple-but-effective barrel-style charcoal grill a few years back, and that thing has already seen a fair share of activity. While in grad school, it would routinely churn out ten-plus pounds of cooked animal, vegetable, and pineapple a week. We were lucky enough at the time to have a garage where routine storage could prevent any serious degradation, but after we moved, my poor cooker was left without a home. Being a bit down on funds I wasn't really in a great place to spend money on frivolities like grill covers either, so the elements were definitely taking a toll.

Now that we've relocated once again, and things are a bit less tight, it seemed like the opportune time to get some adequate protection for one of my favorite household items. It wasn't quite as simple as a new cover, however. The sixth months of harsh New York winters had made a mark and there was a fair amount of visible rust, not to mention a few ex-spider homes.

Not to be deterred, however, I made a trip to the hardware store. My shopping list included a large amount of steel wool, some high temp paint, new stainless steel hardware, and a new smoker box, just for fun.

What came next can best be described as a drastically under-skilled manual laborer toiling away in an unfamiliar sun to achieve a result that someone else could probably have surpassed in a day. Every inch of metal was steel wooled, washed, and painted barring the inside of the barrel. In order to get as clean a slate as possible, the inside was hit hard with the steel brush and washed even harder. Bolts which had become intracably attached to the body were sawed off and replaced with shiny new bits, and when all the paint was dry, the beast was reassembled.

The work now done, it was time to play. So last Sunday, I began by slathering the inside of the barrel with a thick layer of crisco, and then running a batch of coals for over an hour to simultaneously season the inside and help cure the paint. Once that was complete, I loaded up eight pounds of chicken in two batches and made dinner for the week. All tolled, it meant I was outside watching the grill work for "safety reason" for a fair number of hours in the cool shade, listening to music and drinking some beer.

I couldn't ask for a better Sunday. Here's to the next.
