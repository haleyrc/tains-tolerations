title: "IAMADad - Well Visit"

---
This morning I had the distinct displeasure of accompanying my one year old son the doctor for a well visit. I find this title a bit misleading as the only way to know if he's "well" is to go to the visit, and while there the doctor usually does their best to make sure you're absolutely petrified of any number of biological and environmental hazards. This visit was no different. And thanks to the lowest common denominator mentality, I was subjected to a number of gentle reminders not to let my child roam about a moving vehicle, drink drano, or climb out of open windows. I'm glad that someone who misprounced a my son's common, four-letter name was there to instruct me on the best way to not neglect an infant.

Luckily, one thing my son is already a pro at is getting compliments. I can't say anyone has ever mentioned how well proportioned he is, but I suppose that's just the sort of completely-in-touch-with-humanity things doctor's like to say.

I could definitely have done without having to restrain the little one for shots, since doctor visits already make me fairly uncomfortable and this was a great way to share that with my offspring. I was definitely proud, however, since by the time we got him dressed and took a couple deep breaths, all that remained of the bawling was some post-trauma sniffles.

For all of my complaining though, he was given a clean bill of health and development seems to be progressing as expected, so I'll take that as a win for the day.
